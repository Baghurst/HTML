    <h1>What is MMA?</h1>
    <p>Frequently billed as the Worlds fastest growing sport,<br>
         MMA combines wrestling and striking martial arts into one complete discipline,<br>
         including techniques from Thai-boxing, judo, Brazilian jiu jitsu and boxing. <br>
          Although contemporary MMA is only as old as the world’s first website and phenomenally proliferated with the growth of the internet,<br>
           its roots can be traced as far back as Pankration in the ancient Olympic Games.<br>
