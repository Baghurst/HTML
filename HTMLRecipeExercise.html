    an incredibly delicious flavor. <br> You and your guests won't believe that the sauce has only two ingredients! <br>
    This is
    the real, authentic Italian version of a misunderstood classic. <br> Trust us, you'll never go back to the heavy

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp (60g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 oz. (115g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>4 servings of very thin, fresh egg fettuccine</li>
        <li>Pot</li>
        <li>Large platter</li>
        <li>Tongs</li>
        <li>Forks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt it generously. <br> While the water comes up to temp, prepare the
        sauce by
        cutting the butter into thin pats and arranging them evenly on a large platter. <br> Be sure to have your grated
        cheese on hand and ready.


        Add the fettuccine into the boiling water and cook until al dente to your taste. <br> If it's properly thin, it
        can
        boil in as little as 30 seconds. <br> Use tongs to transfer the pasta onto the butter platter, along with a few
        spoonfuls of extra pasta water. <br>


        Working quickly, top the pasta with the grated cheese. <br> Use two forks to vigorously toss the fettuccine
        until the
        butter and cheese have melted and blended together into an even, creamy sauce. <br> Serve immediately. <br>
        Buon Appetito! </p>
